# PYTHON_Eecurity_Encryption
Work with DES algorithm

Development of a program for encryption and signature generation
messages (digitally signed) based on symmetric
DES encryption algorithm. The program implements two modes
work: block encryption and decryption of messages,
as well as the formation of a digital signature (SHS).
It is required to form the source file with text, then
The program generates an encrypted file. Program should
provide the ability to decrypt the encrypted
file, the result of decryption should be equivalent
source file.
In Program encryption mode, you must request input from
keyboard encryption key. Further, the program asks
file name for encryption and file name for recording
encrypted information.
In the mode of building a digital signature, you must request
Enter the encryption key from the keyboard. Next is necessary
encrypt message blocks and collapse them into
according to the SHS scheme - coupling of cipher blocks.
